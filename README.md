# Win98 Screensavers

I'm remaking the windows 98 screensavers for use in OBS Browser Sources.

This project will emulate a windows 98 desktop UI and allow users to select, configure and view a selection of screensavers from Windows 98. Each one will offer it's own url so you can use one of all of them at the same time on OBS if you wish.

Currently working:
